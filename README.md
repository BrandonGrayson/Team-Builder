# Team-Builder

## Description

Welcome to Team Builder the app that simplifies the process of assigning personell. Team Builder was designed to be a cli that runs using node command prompts to receive input from the user. When you're first assigning teams you'll first be asked a series of questions relating to the Manager of the project. Once the Manager has been assigned you can either select to add an engineer or an Intern depending on your needs. Once your team has been built. The output will be rendered to team.html. Open the team.html folder in your respective browser ( We recommend using google chrome whenever possible).
